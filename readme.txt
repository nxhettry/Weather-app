This is a simple weather app build using NodeJs, Ejs, Express, Axios, ans Scss.
i have not uploaded the Scss file due to its large size.

The API is used from Openweather and the Layout is made my myself.
Do see the source code and make a more improved and more stylish weather app.
Have a good day !
